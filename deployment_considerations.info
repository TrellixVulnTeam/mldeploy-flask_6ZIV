per a brief overview of design considerations last week:
    1. API endpoint access. In order to produce operational lift relatively quickly and respond to changes, access via APIs is critical
    2. serverless configuration. to best scale the model's use/infrastructure  in accordance with demand (i.e. lambda)
    3. predictable deployment. obviously terraform wins here
    4. avoiding lock-in. some degree of freedom to pivot will be needed, namely avoiding vendor-specific lock-in (i.e. CodeStar).
